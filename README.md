##About this site##
This is my personal .github.io site.  The base framework is Materialize CSS (http://materializecss.com/).  It should be fully responsive, but I promise nothing for those of you with HiDPi displays.  Also, there's not much here.  On purpose.

##Other
If you have something *better* to put in the footer file a bug on Github.  In fact, please file bugs on Github.

For those of you with HiDPi displays, if you find assets that are not sharp enough for your liking, kindly file a bug on Github.  

####Bugs####
- Do *not* send me emails telling me about bugs.
- Do *not* file style-related bugs that say anything about Material Design.  If you have legit design critiques, please go ahead.  My eye for design is "Oh, I like it."  *Pushes new site style to GitHub.*
- If you can fix issue #6 please do.  *Legally.*
- If you find my readme.md terse and angry-sounding, it is.  File rewrites as bugs.

####Other things people will complain about####
- My lack of detail in commits: Do you know hard it is to write those things?  I have to describe everything I have done and sometimes *I don't feel like it.*
- My website contains no information whatsoever: Tough.
