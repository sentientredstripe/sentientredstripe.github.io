#The Colonies of the Pacific#
----------------------------
Just a small fantasy of mine.

###About###
The Colonies of the Pacific is a small nation composed of 2 islands that when combined are about the size of Hawaii.  They do not actually exist.  

###Economy###
The Colonies are relatively rich for an island nation of their size due to the export and licence of technology that includes seawater to petroleum conversion systems, self-contained land-defense systems, bio-medical technology, and some power storage and generation technology, although these register below 5% of total licencing and export revenues.  The aforementioned export/licensing businesses employ a good portion of the population (47%).

Due to the aforementioned ability to process seawater into oil and therefore any other petroleum-based fuel, it has been proposed by observers that the lack of a need to import oil from other countries is one of the reasons that the country is so comparatively wealthy, although the official Colonial line is that the country's wealth comes from the innovations of its citizens.

###Government###
The Colonies would like to be a direct democracy but doing so would be prohibitive and difficult, and thus a parliamentary system was settled on. 

The government is highly regarded for efficiency and for its ability to get things done even with divided legislative bodies.  This may be due to the fact that opinions are not as deeply divided as in other countries and the population is relatively homogeneous, as well as the way the pay structure is written for those in lawmaking positions.  

Part of the reason for the efficiency is attributed partially to the streamlined beracracy but also because the government does not use paper forms and conducts a majority of its business on the country-wide intranet.  Many common tasks are also automated, significantly speeding up government processes and leaving more complex work to the employed human workers.

###Military & Defense###
The Colonial military is considered quite robust despite its small size.  

####Navy####
The Navy of the Colonies of the Pacific, like all the armed forces of the Colonies, is quite small, being composed of 15 vessels.

The islands and by extension the water around them are divided into patrol quadrants each of which has 3 ships assigned  there.

Each trio is composed of:

- 1 Arleigh-Burke Colonial Flight-class Destroyers
- 1 Freedom-class LCS
- 1 Gotland-class submarine

These patrol forces may be supplemented by Air Force planes as necessary or as determined by the needs of the patrol area.

#####Breakdown of Vessel Choices######
Arleigh-Burke class destroyer:

LCS:  Technically speaking the Freedom-class LCS employed by the Colonial Navy is the more heavily armed and armored version of the LCS but is reffered by the navy as an LCS.

Gotland-class submarine: The Gotland-class submarine is the notable exception is (so far) the only member of the Navy that is not American built.  However, all of the American submarine fleet is nuclear powered and the inconveniences thereof were considered too high by the Colonial Navy and therefore an alternative was required.  Diesel-electric submarines, while cheaper, have low endurance.  Enter AIP, or air independent propulsion.  Unfortunately, 

When a ship class is referred to as a "Colonial Flight," "Colonial Type," or "Colonial Class," it means that the ship design was modified significantly enough to merit it being designated a different subset of the original class.

Generally, the Colonial Navy uses off the shelf or existing designs when ordering vessels, as demonstrated by the trio above.  Save for the destroyer, the trio comes as-is without modifications.  

The Arleigh-Burke Colonial Flight-class Destroyer is relatively similar to a normal Arleigh-Burke class destroyer, with a few notable exceptions:

- A more powerful propulsion and power plant is installed, as speed is considered a valuable asset by Colonial leadership to allow quick asset movement as to make up for the lack of hardware.  This brings the top speed of the vessel to 35 knots.
-  A seawater to fuel oil conversion plant is installed.
-  A marginally larger deck gun is installed.

The Colonial Navy also has a Mobile Group whose mission is to provide the Navy with a fast moving, easily adaptable force that can be used to supplement existing forces.  The Mobile Group is often times the representation of the Colonies of the Pacific at military exercises and the like.

The Mobile Group is comprised of:

- A Ticonderoga-class cruiser
- A Independence-class LCS

While the choice of a cruiser may seem odd, the aim was to keep the force as small as possible and a cruiser seemed like the best way to combine roles.  The cruiser was acquired from the United States Navy and was subsequently modified, in the spirit of the Colonial Navy, with faster engines and seawater conversion technology.

Officially, its capacity is to patrol and defend the islands of the colonies but, thanks to the country's proximity to the South China Sea, has also been pressed into making sure that the colonies are not swept up into China's land grabs, either politically or physically.
